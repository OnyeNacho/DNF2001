Backup of DNF 2001. The DNF Restoration Team apparently acted the fool and took their project with them to the grave. The leader(s) didn't even have the courtesy to tell me that I was booted from their team and why. They left me behind witout notice.
What a bloody waste of my time and hard drive space...

The game resides here if you wish to access it and try your own luck at revival. Good luck.

Besides that, consider DNF2001, as DNF - Did Not Finish.

EDIT: I just got invited to the new Discord for DNF 2001 Restoration. Regardless, I still will not participate on game dev directly anymore. I opted to serve as consultant instead for Unreal ENgine advice (should they require it).
