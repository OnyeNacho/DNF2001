Backup of DNF 2001. The DNF Restoration Team acted the fool and took their project with them to the grave. The leader(s) didn't even have the courtesy to tell me was booted from their team. They left me behind.
What a bloody waste of my time and hard drive space...

The game resides here if you wish to access it and try your own luck at revival. Good luck.

Besides that, consider DNF2001, as DNF - Did Not Finish.
